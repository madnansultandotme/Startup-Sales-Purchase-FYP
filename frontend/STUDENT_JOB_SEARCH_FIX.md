# Student Job Search Fix

## 🐛 **Issue Fixed**: Students Seeing Static Startup Data Instead of Real Job Positions

### **Problem**: 
When students logged in to search for jobs, they were seeing startup-level information (company description, general info) instead of actual job positions with:
- Specific job titles (e.g., "Frontend Developer", "Marketing Manager")
- Job-specific descriptions and requirements
- Skills needed for each position
- Position details like compensation type

### **Root Cause**: 
The system was showing **startup information** instead of **position information**. Students were seeing cards with startup titles/descriptions rather than individual job listings.

---

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Backend Changes**

#### **New API Endpoint**: `/api/positions`
```python
class AllPositionsView(generics.ListAPIView):
    """List all available positions across all startups (for job seekers)"""
    
    def get_queryset(self):
        return Position.objects.filter(
            is_active=True,
            startup__status='active',
            startup__type='collaboration'
        ).select_related('startup', 'startup__owner').order_by('-created_at')
```

**Features**:
- ✅ Returns actual job positions (not just startups)
- ✅ Includes position title, description, requirements
- ✅ Includes associated startup information 
- ✅ Supports filtering by category, field, phase, team size
- ✅ Supports search by job title, description, requirements

#### **Enhanced URL Routing**:
```python
path('api/positions', views.AllPositionsView.as_view(), name='all_positions'),
```

### **2. Frontend Changes**

#### **New JobCard Component**
Created `src/components/JobCard/JobCard.jsx` to display **job information** instead of startup information:

**Key Features**:
- ✅ **Job Title** as primary heading (e.g., "Frontend Developer")
- ✅ **Company Name** as subtitle ("at StartupName")
- ✅ **Job Description** and **Requirements** 
- ✅ **Compensation Type** (equity, salary, etc.)
- ✅ **Team Size** and **Phase** information
- ✅ **Application Count** if available
- ✅ **Requirements Preview** with truncation

#### **Updated API Service**:
```javascript
export const positionAPI = {
  getAllPositions: (params) => apiClient.get('/api/positions', { params }),
  // ... other position endpoints
};
```

#### **Enhanced Collaboration Page**:
- ✅ **Changed from startup listings to position listings**
- ✅ **Added search bar**: "Search jobs by title, description, or company..."
- ✅ **Updated filters**: Category, Field/Industry, Phase, Team Size
- ✅ **Dynamic title**: "Find Jobs" for students, "Job Opportunities" for others
- ✅ **Real-time filtering and search**

#### **Improved Application Flow**:
- ✅ **Position Selection**: Students can choose specific positions to apply for
- ✅ **Position-Specific Details**: Show job requirements and description
- ✅ **Enhanced Form**: Includes position selector in application form
- ✅ **URL Parameter Support**: Direct links to apply for specific positions

```

### **AFTER (Real Job Position Data)**:
```

Description: "We're looking for a React developer to join our team..."
Requirements: "3+ years React experience, TypeScript, etc."
